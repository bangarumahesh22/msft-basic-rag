Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. This approach helps reduce hallucinations and provides more accurate, context-aware responses.

How RAG Works:
1. User submits a query
2. System retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base
3. Retrieved context is combined with the query
4. LLM generates a response based on the retrieved context
5. Response is returned to the user

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduced hallucinations
- Access to up-to-date information
- Domain-specific knowledge integration
- Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning
- Transparent and explainable results

Implementation Components:
- Document store (Azure AI Search)
- Embedding model for semantic search
- Large language model (Azure OpenAI)
- Orchestration layer (FastAPI)
- User interface (Streamlit)

Best Practices:
- Chunk documents appropriately (500-1000 tokens)
- Use hybrid search when possible
- Implement proper error handling
- Add conversation memory for multi-turn dialogues
- Monitor and evaluate response quality
